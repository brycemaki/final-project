  <h1>Endlessly Wandering with Purpose</h1>
  <p>A dude following a few ideas believed to be worth pursuing and documenting it all with a camera in hand...</p>

  <h2>Here's a story</h2>
  <p>In tenth grade I took a seat in history class on a Film Friday. We had these once a month and it was a free day more thn anything. On one particular day, we watched a film called "180 Degress South". A film that replicates the pursuit of summiting Corcovado Volcano in Patagonia. This film opended my eyes to a different style of living. One that has captured my imagination ever since.Since then, I've pushed myself to get out and see the world through my own perspective. To endlessly wander purposefully.</p>

  <h3>Photos</h3>
  <p>The draw of photography is that a photo represents an interpretation unique to the eye in which views it. Each capture means something different among many despite it being the same framework.</p>
